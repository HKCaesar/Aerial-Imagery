AERIAL IMAGERY
Members: Tina Hong Bu, Nikhil Binod Agarwal
Proposal/Notes:
[Zico]
This is a fun one too.  Using Google or similar tools, it's pretty easy to extract aerial images at a high resolution (Google has particularly high resolution, and is easy to query via the static maps API, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/ though they also do limit the number of images you can download per day).  A lot of people have begun work on predicting all sorts of things from aerial images.
 
As a few examples, using the census data from the above link, you could try to predict just about anything about a region using aerial imagery: wealth level, demographic makeup, religion, etc.  Here you'd probably want to do the "standard" trick of using deep-learning based image features, like we did with the VGG features for class, and then training a classifier to predict whatever element you're interested in. 
Data sets:
Google's static maps API:  
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/intro#URL_Parameters

Standard API Usage limit: Link
1.	Free until exceeding 25,000 map loads per 24 hours
2.	640 x 640 maximum image resolution
Plan of work:
1.	Identify Location – Small city / Area / region
2.	What to predict? (See ideas below)
3.	Get data set for target location
4.	Get images of target location
a.	Image segmentation? Overlapping images or not?
b.	Image type? Satellite / hybrid / terrain / roadmap
c.	Multiple images of same location? (Eg. Day & night)
5.	Models & Algorithms [TBD]

Ideas:
1.	Demographic makeup (gender, age, ethnicity, income, residence, smoking status, presence of children, education level, language spoken, etc.)

2.	Wealth level (map poverty)

3.	Religion (? Not sure)

4.	Classify locations (houses, trees, river, roads, etc)

5.	Identify similar locations across the globe (City layout design)

6.	Predict how livable a city is?
